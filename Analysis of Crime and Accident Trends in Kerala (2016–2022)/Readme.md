## Project Title
Analysis of Crime and Accident Trends in Kerala (2016–2022)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing crime and accident trends in the Indian state of Kerala using publicly available multi-year data. The analysis aims to identify year-wise patterns, major contributing crime categories, and overall trends through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization.

## Dataset Description
- Source: Public crime and accident records (Kerala)
- Time Period: 2016 to 2022 (2022 data up to August)
- Format: CSV
### Features:
- Crime Heads (categories)
- Year-wise case counts

## Tools & Technologies
- Python.
- Jupyter Notebook.
- Pandas (data cleaning & manipulation).
- Matplotlib (data visualization).

## Methodology
### 1. Data Understanding
- Examined dataset shape and structure
- Reviewed column names and data types
- Checked for missing values
- Identified number of unique crime categories

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed non-analytical identifier column (Sl.No)
- Renamed year column for consistency
- Reshaped dataset from wide format to long format
- Converted year values to numeric format
- Sorted data by crime category and year for chronological analysis

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed total crime and accident cases across years
- Identified top contributing crime categories
- Examined trends of specific crime types

### 4. Data Visualization
- Line charts to show overall trends
- Bar charts to compare crime categories
- Heatmap to visualize intensity of crimes across years and categories

## Key Insights
- Crime and accident cases in Kerala show noticeable variation across years.
- A small number of crime categories contribute significantly to total cases.
- Serious crimes display relatively stable trends compared to other categories.
- Heatmap visualization highlights category-wise and temporal intensity patterns effectively.
- Such analysis can support administrative monitoring and policy planning.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a structured data analysis workflow, from data cleaning to visualization, and highlights how public data can be used to uncover meaningful trends and support informed decision-making.
